    "text": "Abstract\nSmart metering infrastructures collect data almost continuously in the form of fine-grained long time series. These massive data series often have common daily patterns that are repeated between similar days or seasons and shared among grouped meters. Within this context, we propose an unsupervised method to highlight individuals with abnormal daily dependency patterns, which we term evolution outliers. To this end, we approach the problem from the standpoint of High Dimensional Functional Time Series and we use the concept of functional depth to exploit the dynamic group structure and isolate individual meters with a different evolution. The performance of the proposal is first evaluated empirically through a simulation exercise under different evolution scenarios. Subsequently, the importance and need for an evolution outlier detection method are shown by using actual smart-metering data corresponding to photo-voltaic energy generation and circuit voltage records. Here, our proposal detects outliers that might go unnoticed by other approaches of the literature that have demonstrated to be effective capturing magnitude and shape abnormalities."

    "text": "Abstract\nThe gender gap is a well-known problem in academia and, despite its gradual narrowing, recent estimations indicate that it will persist for decades. Short-term descriptive studies suggest that this gap may have actually worsened during the months of confinement following the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. In this work, we evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on female and male academics’ research productivity using preprint drop-off data. We examine a total of 307,902 unique research articles deposited in 5 major preprint repositories during the period between January and May each year from 2017 to 2020. We find that the proportion of female authors in online repositories steadily increased over time; however, the trend reversed during the confinement and gender parity worsened in two respects. First, the proportion of male authors in preprints increased significantly during lockdown. Second, the proportion of male authors in COVID-19-related articles was significantly higher than that of women. Overall, our results imply that the gender gap in academia suffered an approximately 1-year setback during the strict lockdown months of 2020, and COVID-related research areas suffered an additional 1.5-year setback."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nPartially observed functional data are frequently encountered in applications and are the object of an increasing interest by the literature. We here address the problem of measuring the centrality of a datum in a partially observed functional sample. We propose an integrated functional depth for partially observed functional data, dealing with the very challenging case where partial observability can occur systematically on any observation of the functional dataset. In particular, differently from many techniques for partially observed functional data, we do not request that some functional datum is fully observed, nor we require that a common domain exist, where all of the functional data are recorded. Because of this, our proposal can also be used in those frequent situations where reconstructions methods and other techniques for partially observed functional data are inapplicable. By means of simulation studies, we demonstrate the very good performances of the proposed depth on finite samples. Our proposal enables the use of benchmark methods based on depths, originally introduced for fully observed data, in the case of partially observed functional data. This includes the functional boxplot, the outliergram and the depth versus depth classifiers. We illustrate our proposal on two case studies, the first concerning a problem of outlier detection in German electricity supply functions, the second regarding a classification problem with data obtained from medical imaging. Supplementary materials for this article are available online."

    "text": "Abstract\nThe problem of estimating missing fragments of curves from a functional sample has been widely considered in the literature. However, most reconstruction methods rely on estimating the covariance matrix or the components of its eigendecomposition, which may be difficult. In particular, the estimation accuracy might be affected by the complexity of the covariance function, the noise of the discrete observations, and the poor availability of complete discrete functional data. We introduce a non-parametric alternative based on depth measures for partially observed functional data. Our simulations point out that the benchmark methods perform better when the data come from one population, curves are smooth, and there is a large proportion of complete data. However, our approach is superior when considering more complex covariance structures, non-smooth curves, and when the proportion of complete functions is scarce.

However, most reconstruction methods rely on estimating the covariance matrix or the components of its eigendecomposition, which may be difficult. In particular, the estimation accuracy might be affected by the complexity of the covariance function, the noise of the discrete observations, and the poor availability of complete discrete functional data. We introduce a non-parametric alternative based on depth measures for partially observed functional data.

It shows that integrated depths, e.g., the popular modified band depth, do not result in well-defined boxplots. Instead, we argue that infimal depths are the only functional depths that provide a valid construction of a functional boxplot. We also show that the properties of the boxplot are completely determined by properties of the one-dimensional depth function used in defining the infimal depth for functional data. Our claims are supported by (i) a motivating example, (ii) theoretical results concerning the properties of the boxplot, and (iii) a simulation study."
