::: {#hero-heading}
I am Assistant Professor in the Department of Statistics and Operational Research at [Universidad de Málaga](https://www.uma.es/). 
I strongly believe in the potential of Statistics to help with the great challenges of today's society. This belief drives my commitment to teach, open science and to bridging the gap between academic research and real-world problems.
