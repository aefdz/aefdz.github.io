::: {#hero-heading}
I am Associate Professor in the Department of Statistics and Operational Research at [Universidad de Málaga](https://www.uma.es/). 
I strongly believe in the potential of Statistics to deal with the great challenges of today's society. This belief drives my commitment to bridging the gap between theoretical research and real-world problems.
