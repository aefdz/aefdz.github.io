I am Assistant Professor in the Department of Mathematics, Statistics and Operational Research at [Universidad de Málaga](https://www.uma.es/).

Before that, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at [OASYS group](https://sites.google.com/view/groupoasys/home). In 2020, I got my PhD from the [Department of Statistics](https://www.uc3m.es/ss/Satellite/UC3MInstitucional/es/PortadaMiniSiteA/1371229065435/Departamento_de_Estadistica) at [Universidad Carlos III de Madrid](https://uc3m.es/) with the dissertation "Depth-based methods for Functional Data Analysis". 
During my doctoral period, I had the pleasure to be a visiting researcher at [Mox Laboratory](https://mox.polimi.it/) of the [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it/en/) and at the [College of Business and Economics](https://www.cbe.anu.edu.au/) of the [Australian National University](https://www.anu.edu.au/).

I strongly believe in the need to create bridges between theoretical statistical research and the great challenges of today's society.
