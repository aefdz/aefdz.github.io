This is the project of my personal website!

CREDITS: 

This website was made possible thanks to the open-source community, particularly the contributions of [Andrew Heiss](https://www.andrewheiss.com/),  [Javier Liébana](https://javieralvarezliebana.es/) and [Silvia Canelón](https://silviacanelon.com/). 
Their projects and teaching materials have inspire me in the creation of this site and my own materials.
